# Wondermarket-Sales-Dashboard
This GitHub repository contains the source code and materials for a data analysis project conducted on behalf of Wondermarket, a prominent retail supermarket chain. The project aimed to address several key business challenges faced by Wondermarket, including identifying the best and worst-performing stores, understanding regions with growth potential, and determining the top-selling products to maximize profitability in new store openings.

Using Power BI, a comprehensive data visualization and analytics tool, we conducted an in-depth analysis of transactional data provided by Wondermarket. The dataset included information such as store locations, product details, quantities sold, prices, revenues, and payment methods. Leveraging Power BI's robust capabilities, we performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the underlying patterns and trends within the data.

The analysis encompassed various aspects, including:

Store Performance Analysis: We assessed the performance of each store based on revenue generated, profitability, and other relevant metrics. Visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps were utilized to highlight performance variations across different store locations.

Regional Growth Opportunities: By examining sales trends and customer behavior data across different regions, we identified areas with significant growth potential for Wondermarket. Insights derived from the analysis helped the company prioritize expansion efforts and allocate resources effectively.

Product Performance Evaluation: We analyzed product sales data to determine the top-performing products within specific categories and store locations. This information was crucial for optimizing inventory management, pricing strategies, and product assortment decisions.

The findings and insights generated from this analysis were presented in a comprehensive dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard provided stakeholders and decision-makers at Wondermarket with a user-friendly interface to explore key metrics, visualize trends, and make data-driven decisions to drive business growth and profitability.
